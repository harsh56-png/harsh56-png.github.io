            THRILL! THRILL! THRILL!
            Bringing you a goosebumps guaranteed thrill to watch, registering itself in the Indian Web Series blockbusters, here is SPECIAL OPS. Who says that thrill recites in just Hollywood ? Yet again, the Indian directors and writers prove that the Indian cinema still has the potential of delivering an audience influencing thrill packed series. SPECIAL OPS completely stands on its audience’s expectations and here is what we review from it:
            The series is released in 2020, with a total of 8 episodes uniquely named after the hit songs of Indian cinema. Each episode extends upto a duration of around 50 min, completely hooking up its audience for the entire duration. The series is directed by a known thrill Movie/Web Series director “Neeraj Pandey” and “Shivam Nair”, casting a set of extraordinary acting talent including in the lead   “Kay Kay Menon” and “Karan Tacker”. The in series leading characters include “Himmat Singh”, “Farooq Ali”, “Ikhlaq Khan”, “Wasim Karachiwala” and many more.
            The series involves an investigation story attempting to catch an extremely mastermind terrorist involved in almost every terrorist attack that took place in India. Thus, with a thrill of twist and turns at every single minute, it fills the audience with a feeling of patriotism and respect for all the unidentified Indian Agents who serve the country not on the borders, rather away from anyone’s notice. Every episode of the series brings you an unexpected theory, completely different from that of a person would have expected. Though being a work of fiction, the series brings up its storyline of incidents in the most realistic ways. Also, an extremely brilliant bright side of the series, along with an equally brilliant opposite side, fills the audience with thrill and excitement.
            Taking an overall view, the series proves to be worth watching for all the thriller loving fans. Completely different scenarios from what a person expects, the series completely stands on their expectations. Moreover, the outstanding acting of “Kay Kay Menon”, filled with a pack of suspense and excitement along with the extreme action scenes and acting by “Karan Tacker” with an extraordinary presence of mind will win your hearts.
            Bringing a complete pack of excitement, the series hooks you up for the entire duration. Also, the rumours of the Second part of the series were spread which anyways prove to be false. Leaving the second part apart, the first season will give you thrills, wow moments, action packed scenes, intelligence and what not. Moreover, the series alongside depicts a small portion an officers personal life, which rather proves to be worthless having no connection with the plot, but surely adds a mind relaxing time in scenario where one cannot afford to skip even the smallest of things.
            Altogether, the series from my side is a YES to watch, rather, a must watch.
