            Bringing you a back to back collection of extraordinary stories, HOTSTAR has now been in race with some of the well known Web Series producing sources. Another such series that HOTSTAR delivers to its viewers is " CRIMINAL JUSTICE " . Coming up with another unique concept, the series you an adventurous view of a life in Jail, along with carrying an exceptional case into the minds of people.
            A good cast makes everything great. The series although has a very unique concept and areas to cover, its cast on the same hand adds much more to its glory with their acting skills. The contains some of the known bollywood actors including “ Vikrant Massey “ , “ Pankaj Tripathi “ , “ Rucha Inamdar “ , “ Anupriya Goenka “ , “ Jackie Shroff “ and several others. Having directed by “ Tigmanshu Dhulia “ , the series shows an extremely well direction in every field. The series was a much awaited one before its release and was finally handed to the audience in 2019. The series contains a total of 10 episodes with a duration of approximately 50 minutes. 
            CRIMINAL JUSTICE apart from all concepts, shares a very unique combination of things including action , crime , drama , mystery and thrill. The series revolves around the lines, where an innocent boy of nearly 22 is put behind the bars and how he deals with life thereafter in Jail. Moreover, the series also brings us the fact that by the time law announces its decision, it is way too late for the victim who has already lost a major part of his life and carrier.
            The series no doubt, hooks the viewers form the very first episode, from where the plot starts to build. As the series moves forward, the introduction and entry of one of Bollywood’s greatest actors “ Jackie Shroff “ , and the extraordinary realistic looks that he shows will win anyone’s heart. The series surely contains a suspense, which altogether hooks the audience and compels them to think of WHAT NEXT ? CRIMINAL JUSTICE is surely a content to which , one not only appreciate the writing of the plot, but infact , the same amount of credit goes to Vikrant Massey , Pankaj Tripathi and Jackie Shroff , for carrying the roles in the best of the ways possible.
            HOTSTAR has now became an important choice of people when they think of the best contents to watch. Thus, this HOTSTAR SPECIAL is again a punch from hotstar and a must watch to get some thrills for yourself.
            So, my review suggests that one must watch the series, taking along an adventure to the life in Jail. Go, hit the thrill to your body then.
