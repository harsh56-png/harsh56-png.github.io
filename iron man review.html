            Bringing to its viewers an amazing combination of action and technology the first part of IRON MAN is a thrill to watch.
            Having written by "Mark Fergus","Hawk Ostby" and based on the comics by "Stan Le", the movie is directed by "Jon Favreau". The movie extends to a duration of 2 hours 6 min and was released in 2008. Also containing an amazing cast including "Robert Downey Jr.",  " Gwyneth Paltrow" and many others, the outstanding acting with a mixture of slight comedy by Robert will make you love him till infinity. 
            The movie's main idea is the discovery of a highly advanced  IRON MAN suit and how it changes the entire world with its existence. Since, no movie is complete without a villain,the movie on contrast shares the idea that technology can be useful and harmful for mankind.
            The movie definitely contains many Wow and hooking up moments where one is lost into the IRON MAN world and doesn't really wanna come out of it. Being just the beginning/just the first part, the movie mostly focuses on the building and coming into being of the IRON MAN. Not to take it negatively, this concept is just more than enough to hook anyone for the entire duration.
            Thus, summing up the things , IRON MAN doesn't bore you even in the least of the ways and is highly recommended for everyone, especially for the Sci-Fi movie lovers.
