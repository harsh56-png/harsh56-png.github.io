            The fourth season will surely make you clap for the professor.
            The season being released in 2020 was a much awaited one by the audience as it left them half way. Thus, in a hope of reaching their destination the series was highly watched and praised all over. Containing 8 episodes similar to the 3rd one the duration also remains till 40-60 minutes each.
            The end of the third season definitely left the story incomplete , but in addition to it, it also left the audience on the sad side. The fourth season on the contrary shows us a completely changed attitude of the professor when he is struck hard by the Spanish police. The professor in this season plays attacking rather than defending himself, thus taking a lot more risks and with a lot more deep tricks and planning. The heist thus continues further but with much more excitement and a completely changed attitude of the gang. 
            The first heist was a two season game, thus likewise the audience thought the second heist to be of the same duration. But giving its audience a thrill again, the heist is again left in suspense in the end of fourth season. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So, here we are on the same page waiting for the 5th season of the heist and the reliving of the gang and the plan.
