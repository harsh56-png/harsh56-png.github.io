            Bringing to its viewers an amazing tour of the Lucknow city being the main location of the movie, the movie is given a brilliant direction by “Shoojit Sircar” and written by “Juhi Chaturvedi”. Not only the brilliance in direction, the movire receives an amazing cast, playing a typical old Lucknowa resident “Mirza” by “Amitabh Bachchan” and another lead character of the story “Baankey Rastogi” by “Ayushman Khurana”. The movie also contains other top class actors including "Vijay Raaz" and "Brijendra Kala", whose presence in the scenes , fill the entire storyline with interest and a thrill of comedy dialogues from time to time.
            
             
            
            The entire location of the story revolves around the “Lucknow-The City of Nawabs”, having a number old and huge Havelies, and the entire story revolves around one such particular Haveli, including comedy dialogues, stupendous acting and the addition of the role of Vijay Raaz, makes it even worth watching.

            Thus, all in all, the entire movie is unique in itself and is worth watching, introducing you with the “Lucknowa” language and culture, unless you are from the same city. If one is well aware of Lucknow’s unique culture, the movie is even more worth watching, meeting their culture on the big screen.</p>
